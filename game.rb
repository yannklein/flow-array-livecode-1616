# Build a ğŸª¨/ğŸ§»/ğŸ’‡

# ğŸª¨ beats ğŸ’‡
# ğŸ§» beats ğŸª¨
# ğŸ’‡ beats ğŸ§»
# same result draw 

# Pseudo-code
# 1. Ask user ğŸª¨/ğŸ§»/ğŸ’‡?
# 2. Get the user input
# 3. Pick a random ğŸª¨/ğŸ§»/ğŸ’‡
# 4. Compare result:
#   - if user pick is equal to computer pick -> draw 
#   - if u:rock and c:paper or u:scissor c:rock or u:paper and c:scissor --> lose 
#   - else --> win
# 5. display the outcome

# Code
